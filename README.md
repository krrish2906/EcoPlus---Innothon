# 🌍 EcoPulse – Civic Platform for Environmental Reporting and Action

## 🧩 Problem Statement

We are building a **web-based solution** that empowers citizens to report garbage-affected or polluted areas by uploading images, descriptions, and geolocation data. This platform will serve as a **bridge between the public, local authorities, and environmental organizations**, ensuring that issues are brought to attention quickly and transparently.

In addition, the platform will allow **NGOs and community groups to promote environmental events** such as tree plantation drives, clean-up campaigns, and sustainability workshops. Citizens can **discover, join, and contribute** to these events, creating a network of **community-driven environmental action**.

Our goal is to create a **digital ecosystem for civic engagement and environmental accountability**, turning everyday observations into impactful change.
